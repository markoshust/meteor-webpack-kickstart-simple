# meteor-webpack-kickstart-simple

This project is a variation/fork of <a href="https://github.com/thereactivestack/kickstart-simple">`kickstart-simple`</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thereactivestack/kickstart-hugeapp">`kickstart-hugeapp`</a>.

It is intended to be a very clean, simple base to start a large project (simpler than the other kickstarts, but providing a good base for a larger project). Please reference the other kickstarts for more detailed info on advanced topics such as code splitting, reactive data integration with Meteor, and how this all works.

## Get Started

To get started, just run the `meteor` command.

## Notes

This project setups up a fictitious company named Foo. Change any references of Foo to your company name, and you have a really clean kickstart for your large project.
